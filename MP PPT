Objectives

1. To segment road scenes using deep learning.


2. To identify vehicles, pedestrians, lanes, and traffic signs.


3. To use both local details and overall context for better accuracy.


4. To work well in different conditions (day/night, weather, traffic).


5. To reduce errors in road scene understanding.


6. To support safer and smarter autonomous driving.

Abstract

1.Road scene understanding is important for autonomous driving and traffic safety.

2.Semantic segmentation helps classify road elements like cars, pedestrians, lanes, and signs.

3.Traditional methods focus only on pixel-wise labeling and miss global context.

4.Vision-driven deep learning uses CNNs/Transformers to capture both local details and overall scene context.

5.This improves accuracy and robustness in complex road conditions (day, night, weather, traffic).

6.The approach enables safer and smarter navigation in real-world environments.

Problem Understanding

1. Road scenes are complex with many objects like vehicles, lanes, pedestrians, and traffic signs.


2. Traditional methods only classify pixels but ignore overall scene context.


3. Similar-looking objects (e.g., road vs. sidewalk) often cause misclassification.


4. Changing conditions like lighting, weather, and traffic make segmentation harder.


5. Lack of contextual understanding reduces accuracy and reliability in real-world use.


6. Autonomous driving needs a robust and context-aware system for safe navigation.

Proposed System

1. Use deep learning models (CNN + Transformer) to process road images.


2. Extract local features (lanes, vehicles, pedestrians, signs) from the scene.


3. Capture global context to understand the full road environment.


4. Combine local and global features for accurate semantic segmentation.


5. Train and test the system on road scene datasets for real-world conditions.


6. Provide reliable, real-time road scene understanding to support autonomous driving.
Changing conditions – Roads look different in day/night, rain, fog, or shadows, which makes recognition difficult.


2. Objects blocking each other – Cars, people, and bikes sometimes hide parts of each other, causing confusion.


3. Unbalanced objects – Common things like cars are easy to detect, but rare ones like animals or traffic signs are often missed.


4. Need for speed – Systems must work very fast for self-driving cars, but detailed segmentation is slow.


5. Lack of context – Models may detect objects but not understand their meaning (e.g., person walking vs. standing).
